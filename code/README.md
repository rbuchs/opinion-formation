I have implemented a function that does the simulation while all the components are not in consensus.
That seems to work well when phi is 1 but not when phi is 0. It might just be a problem of number of time steps. Though it seems to need a huge number of it.

The code seems to work. Should now send with various phi and graphs to cluster to replicate paper results

Submittin job on cluster works. But takes way too much time
